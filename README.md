# Portfolio
This provides a summary and links to various projects created by me, John Vincent Urbano.

## [Top Github Repos for the day](https://github.com/kyrlain/GithubRepoScrape)
This project will scrape the top 15 repositories of each language, based on the number of stars today. This project is written in python with jupyter notebook. The scraping mechanism is written using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` modules. The dataframes is then loaded to a `SQLite` database and a `csv` file.

## [Creating a RAG Chatbot using Cortex and Streamlit in Snowflake](https://github.com/kyrlain/SnowflakeRAGChatbot)
This is a project guiding how to create a Chatbot using Snowflake, as outlined in [Tasty Bytes - RAG Chatbot Using Cortex and Streamlit quickstart](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/tasty_bytes_rag_chatbot_using_cortex_and_streamlit). The chatbot uses Snowflake's Cortex to access various LLMs and is displayed using Streamlit.

## [Tasty Bytes Tutorials in Snowflake](https://github.com/kyrlain/SnowflakeTastyBytesTutorial)
This is a compilation of projects containing introductory tutorials on Snowflake using their sample Tasty Bytes database.

## [Geospatial Analysis in Snowflake](https://github.com/kyrlain/SnowflakeSample)
This is a project that follows the outlined process in [Geospatial Analysis of Precisely Datasets using Snowflake Notebooks and Streamlit](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/using_precisely_enrich_data). This project uses `geopandas` to display geospatial data, particulary the `MICROCODE` `13123031007`. `Streamlit` is the used to display the map.
